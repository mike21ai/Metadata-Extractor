# Metadata Extractor & Anomaly Detector
This is a web-based prototype designed for auditors and investigators to quickly analyze file metadata for potential signs of fraud or manipulation.

This tool extracts and displays detailed metadata from PDF, JPG, and PNG files. It automatically flags common anomalies that could indicate a file has been edited or tampered with, helping to prioritize files that require further investigation.

# Key Features:

- Multi-File Support: Analyze single files or bulk files within a .zip archive.

- Detailed Extraction: Pulls extensive metadata from PDFs and EXIF data from images (JPG/PNG).

- Risk Analysis: Automatically provides a risk assessment (High, Medium, Low) based on anomalies like software tags, mismatched dates, and missing information.

- Auditor-Friendly Summary: Displays a top-level summary that ranks all analyzed files by их risk level for quick review.
